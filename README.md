# Lazy EMD
Lazy Earth Mover's Distance

This repository contains a primary implementation of Lazy-EMD.

## Requirements
- python (==3.x)
- bert_score (==0.2.2)
- POT (==0.6.0)

## Usage
The simplest way is to copy `score.py` and `utils.py` to your `bert_score` file; and copy `unbalanced.py` to your `ot` file.
The usage is then similar as BERTScore. See `sample.py` for an example.
